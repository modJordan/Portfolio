    <p><strong>About Me:</strong>Hello, my name is Jordan. I love puzzles, anime and video games. Anything that gets my
      mind going is my fix.
      The
      reason I love programming is because of the creativity and freedom you have to bring an idea to life. Along with
      my love for my hobbies, I love making things. Whether its building a PC, disassembling hardware or crafting a
      cosplay to bring my favorite character to life- I live for it!
